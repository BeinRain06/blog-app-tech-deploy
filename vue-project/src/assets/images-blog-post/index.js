    Title: 'sewing - Students',
    Author: 'britannica kid',
    image: Sew,
    summary:
      'The art of sewing is at least 20,000 years old. Ancient peoples joined pieces of material using bone and horn needles and animal sinew for thread. Around the 14th century iron needles were invented, and by the 15th century there were eyed needles. Later sewing needles were made of steel, as they still are today. In the 1800s the first practical sewing machine appeared, and today most sewing is done by machine, though some sewers still choose to perform fine sewing and finishing by hand',

    summary: `In the best of all possible worlds, teams are formed deliberately and carefully to meet work needs that an individual or a group of individuals cannot meet as effectively. Although many groups are called "teams," not every work group is a team. In a work group, performance is a function of what its members do as individuals. The focus in a work group is individual goals and accountabilities. A team's performance is measured primarily by the products produced collectively by the team.`,
